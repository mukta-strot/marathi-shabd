## Motivation

When speaking or writing in Marathi we often, **unknowingly** and
**unnecessarily** use a **lot of English words**.
Though this is a natural way for a language to evolve (by using loanwords), the 
way in which it is currently happening is severly impacting the Marathi language.
Some of the reasons, in my opinion, being -

- most of the English words are not adding to any missing gaps in the Marathi 
vocabulary, but instead replacing existing words. 
The Marathi language (like all other Indian languages) already has an extremely
vast, diverse and beautiful vocabulary.
- with every next generation of Maharashtrians, the knowledge of Marathi
  vocabulary is reducing and it may have reduced drastically in the past few decades.
- as the reach of English medium schools and the internet widens, this phenomena
  will continue to grow even to rural areas. Even today's TV serials, web
series, Youtube channels etc. have an extremely Englishised version of Marathi.
- and last, but not the least, we all don't even realise that this is happening.
  Which means that no one is taking any corrective action on it, and this
problem continues to grow like an avalanche.

Here is an excellent example from [this speech](https://youtu.be/Jg7UUU8R_Dc).

**Fresh vegetable आणून त्यांना boil करा, मग त्यांना mash करून त्याचं dough बनवा. मग त्याला cut करून deep fry करा.**

8 out of the 20 words (40%) are in English! And most of us urban folk speak like
this, without even realising it.

## Request

1. From now on whenever you speak (or write) in Marathi, try to observe the amount of English
you use in it (like in the example above).
2. Then try to correct youself. Use this website (or any website/source you like) to help
   you find the right Marathi words.
3. Ask your family, friends, relatives to do the same.
4. Lastly, do share this page with others on social media and messaging apps.
