# मराठी शब्द

मराठी भाषा वाचवण्यासाठी मी हा ओपन सोर्स प्रोजेक्ट सुरू केला आहे. 

माझ्या मते, आपली भाषा हळूहळू आणि कोणाचाही लक्षात न येता एका मृत भाषेच्या दिशेने वाटचाल करत आहे. 
या उपक्रमात सगळ्यांचे स्वागत आहे, ज्यांना कोणाला हा एक गंभीर विषय वाटतो व त्यात काही सुधारणा करण्याची गरज आहे असे वाटते. 

अगदी सोप्या रीतीने सांगायचं झाला तर खालील उदाहरण पहा - 

१. मराठी वाक्यांमधील इंग्रजी शब्दांचा जास्त आणि अनावश्यक वापर.

  - **अयोग्य** - "फार bore झालंय. चला एखादा picture बघूया."
  - **योग्य** - "फार कंटाळा आलाय. चला एखादा चित्रपट बघूया. "

२. देवनगरीऐवजी लॅटिन अक्षरे वापरुन मराठी टायपिंग / लिहिणे

  - **अयोग्य** - "me tujhya sobat marathi bolat ahe."
  - **योग्य** - "मी तुझ्या सोबत मराठीत बोलत आहे."

# Marathi shabd

## About

This project is being developed as a part of an effort **to help save the Marathi 
language** from its gradual and unnoticeable decline into a dying language.


### Goal
---

(This is the goal of the **overall idea** and not just this project.)

**Revive the usage of Marathi language in its original/unadulterated
form in day-to-day life in both spoken and written medium.**


### How to do it?

---

1. Make people realise that [these problems](#problems) exist
2. Motivate them to work towards fixing it
3. Provide them with resources (this project basically is a part of this step)
4. Ask them to do actually implement this in their daily life

This will be done with a combination of videos, blogs and software tools
such as this.
(*Contributions in all these are welcome.*)

## Overview of this project

The idea is to have a static website (ad free, bloat free and fast) where 
people, looking to improve their Marathi vocabulary, can search for an English 
word/phrase and quickly find its Marathi equivalent, and also usage example 
wherever possible.

Words can also be categorised into various topics (tags) so that words used in
same context can be found together to improve the vocabulary those particular 
topics. More features can be added in the future, if necessary.

So basically it will be an **ad-free and fast English-to-Marathi thesaurus for 
day-to-day words** with some additonal features.

## Development and contribution
It is currently in its very initial stage where I am conceptualising it and
looking for contributors (developers as well as people well versed in the
Marathi language).

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details about the **project structure and
general contribution guidelines.**

Some places to do contributions

- **Database update** - adding English words with Marathi equivalents
- **Static website creation** - Basically parsing the database and creating an 
output markdown file with all the content. This file will be used on the 
github.io static website page. 
  - **note** - I would particularly like help in this area as it is new to me as
well.
- **Adding/correcting content in Marathi language** to this project's 
documentation (readme, website pages etc.)

*(This is the current plan and can be improvised.)*

**[Please suggest your ideas, comments etc. in the "Discussions"
page.](https://github.com/mukta-strot/marathi-shabd/discussions)**

I also have in mind quite a few other ideas related to creating resources in 
Marathi language, which I plan to start once I have this project's website first
 ready at some usable level.

## What is the need to do this?<a name="problems"></a>

As I see it, there 2 main problems which are explained below -

1. **Excessive use of English words in Marathi sentences.**

Simply stated this is using a lot of English words in our sentences where 
we could easily use Marathi words. Example - 

  - Not OK - **"फार bore झालंय. चला एखादा picture बघूया."** 
  - OK - **"फार कंटाळा आलाय. चला एखादा चित्रपट बघूया. "**

 The direct consequence of this is that we are loosing our grip on the Marathi
vocabulary. And this problem is ever growing like a snowball, which needs
external force and motivation to fix it. This problem exists in both the spoken
as well as the written form. Also while this is particularly serious in the 
urban population, it may also expand to rural areas as the reach of English 
schools and the internet widens. 

*This project currently is for working on the above problem only.*

2. **Typing/writing Marathi using the Latin alphabet instead of Devanagari.** 

This is basically typing Marathi like this 

   - Not OK - **"me tujhya sobat marathit bolat ahe."**
   - OK - **"मी तुझ्या सोबत मराठीत बोलत आहे."**
   
This problem is something that I feel should not exist in today's date, as we 
now have good keyboards for typing in Marathi using Devanagari on all platforms 
be it mobile or computers.  However it continues to exist, as people find it 
easier to type using Latin alphabet on the qwerty keyboard.
